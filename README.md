# vanilla-js-calculator
A simple calculator project built using vanilla JS.

The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by my desire to strengthen my JavaScript skills and gain hands-on experience with DOM manipulation and event handling.
