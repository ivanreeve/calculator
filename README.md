# vanilla-js-calculator
A simple calculator project built using vanilla JS.

The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This project was inspired by my desire to strengthen my JavaScript skills and gain hands-on experience with DOM manipulation and event handling.
